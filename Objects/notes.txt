Two dynamic arrays.
One for entries whose hash values' LSBs are 0; the other for whose LSBs are 1.

Extension: experiment with 2^p arrays using lowest p bits.

---
When inserting into a layer:
    Use LSB to determine which dynamic array to search.

=> A dynamic array needs to know how to perform find!!!
